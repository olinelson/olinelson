The year 2025 is almost upon us. If you listen to certain parts of the internet you would be forgiven for having the impression that all things programming related will soon be performed exclusively by AI, "Why learn how to code? No point!". Even if we leave to one side the glaring shortcomings of even the finest AI models today (see DHH's take on this here) I think there has never been a better time to learn how to program.

When I was a kid I resisted my Dad teaching me maths. The conversation would go something like this:

Oli: Why do I need to learn maths?
Dad: You'll need it for lot's of things in life, like figuring out how much change to give a customer, if you work in a shop.
Oli: Don't be silly, they have machines that do it for them!

It's not difficult to see the flaws in young Oli's argument. Yet it is the same argument floating around today in regards to programming and AI. Does a calculator replace the need for a person to learn basic mathematics? Or is it a tool that amplifies the abilities of a person to perform calculations?

It's undeniable that the time and energy required to learn the basics of coding today is a fraction of what it was a few years ago.

How could you improve your life by becoming digitally literate? What businesses would you build? What problems would you solve?

 Let 2025 be the year of the generalist.
