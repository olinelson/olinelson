In a world of abundance, the answer is curation

When the barriers to entry are lowered, the differentiator is taste

When machines are more capable than ever, personality is everything

When everyone has a team of team of AI yes men at their beckoned call, you need someone who says NO

Human Programmers is a community and unDirectory of hand-picked software professionals. Digital Renaissance men and women with taste, purpose, and opinions. Humans dedicated to the craft of building things that serve a purpose, with care.

First principles over ‘Best practice’

Ability over Credentials

Evidence over Experience

Human Programmers will be launching soon with a list of only 50 hand-picked software professionals. The selection process is completely and unapologetically subjective.

No paywall. Anyone can browse the unDirectory. We run on an honesty system. If you or your company hires one of our humans, we ask that you support us with a one-time thank you payment of $200 USD. We also welcome sponsorships from like-minded organisations or individuals.
