> In a world of abundance, the answer is **curation**.
> When the barriers to entry are lowered, the differentiator is **taste**.
> When machines are more capable than ever, **personality** is everything.
> When everyone has a team of AI yes-men at their beck and call, you need someone who says **NO**.

[**Human Programmers**](https://humanprogrammers.com) is a community and _unDirectory_ of hand-picked software professionals.

Digital Renaissance men and women with
**taste**, **purpose**, and **opinions** â€”
humans dedicated to building things that matter,
crafted with care and intention.


- **First principles** over â€˜Best practiceâ€™
- **Ability** over Credentials
- **Evidence** over Experience

[**Human Programmers**](https://humanprogrammers.com) will be launching **soon**
with a list of just
**50 hand-picked software professionals**.

The selection process is entirely, and unapologetically, **subjective**.

No paywall.
Anyone can browse the unDirectory.

We run on an honesty system:
If you or your company hires one of our humans,
we ask for a one-time **thank you** payment of **$200 USD**.

We also welcome sponsorships from like-minded organizations and individuals.
